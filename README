===About===
This is a Statistics Webapp designed for Google Chrome, written in Javascript, by Adel Qalieh et al. 

'''Skills Used:''' HTML, Javascript, CSS, jquery, jquery UI

===For new developers:===
Right now, all of the basic calculations have been implemented for the 3 main distributions, Z, Student T, and Chi Squared.

What still needs to be done: 
*Implementation of a 2-SampTTest (A Student T Test for 2 populations, if possible have it both pooled and not pooled)
*Include both 1 tailed and 2 tailed stats for all distributions
*Calculation of p value for a range of Z values for the Z distribution, for example from -1 to 1 = 0.68
