What still needs to be done: 
*jquery UI to make it user friendly 
*Implementation of a 2-SampTTest (A Student T Test for 2 populations, if possible have it both pooled and not pooled)
*Include both 1 tailed and 2 tailed stats for all distributions
*Calculation of p value for a range of Z values for the Z distribution, for example from -1 to 1 = 0.68

This is a Statistics Webapp designed for Google Chrome, written in Javascript, by Adel Qalieh and Moaz Sinan.

Skills Used: HTML, Javascript, CSS, jquery, jquery UI

For new developers interested in contributing:
